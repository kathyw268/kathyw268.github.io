<p>This book gets a lot of criticism for glamourizing “suicidal tendencies” but as someone who lives her life with reckless abandon, it resonated with me in a way I didn’t expect.</p>

<p>Jon Krakauer details the true story of Chris McCandless, a young man who gives up all of his material possesions to embark on a journey of self-reliance. His lust for adventure leads him to the Alaskan wilderness where he meets his demise.</p>

<p>It was easy for me to relate to McCandless’ angsty demeanor and admire his passion for life but if you don’t have an affinity for the wilderness, his actions just seem impulsive and selfish.</p>
