I've been on the look out for a book that will drastically change my life. I'm putting too many expectations on a single book but there are books that have affected my perspective and helped me grow as a person. I'm not necessarily recommending these books but they'll give you a lot of insight on my personality and how I think.  

## Ender's Game

I read a lot as kid but I was mainly motivated by stickers and free pizza. Ender's Game was the first book that I was forced to read that I really enjoyed. At the time, I just felt lucky that I was able to read a fun book for school. I later realized that it introduced me to a lot of philosophical concepts. 

It follows a boy named Ender as he trains in Battle School to become a soldier in humanity's war against Buggers, an alien species. Ender is known for having the right balance of empathy and ruthlessness needed for war. He displays these traits throughout the book causing me to question my moral beliefs. Not saying I was a heartless child, but I never really considered the concept of compassion especially for characters that didn't directly relate to me. 

Ender's Game taught me how to care.

> “In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it’s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. And then, in that very moment when I love them.... I destroy them.” 

## Into the Wild

This book gets a lot of criticism for glamourizing "suicidal tendencies" but as someone who lives her life with reckless abandon, it resonated with me in a way I didn't expect. 

Jon Krakauer details the true story of Chris McCandless, a young man who gives up all of his material possesions to embark on a journey of self-reliance. His lust for adventure leads him to the Alaskan wilderness where he meets his demise.

It was easy for me to relate to McCandless' angsty demeanor and admire his passion for life but if you don't have an affinity for the wilderness, his actions just seem impulsive and selfish.  

Into the Wild put my spirit into words.

> "We like companionship, see, but we can’t stand to be around people for very long. So we go get ourselves lost, come back for a while, then get the hell out again."
