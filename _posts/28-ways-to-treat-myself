Today is my golden birthday (when your age matches the date of your birth. For example, I turned 28 on the 28th). Growing up my mom constantly told me my birthdate is lucky. 8 is a lucky number in Chinese culture and I have 2 of them in my birthdate. [Here's a very credible source I found explaining why](http://blog.tutorming.com/expats/lucky-and-unlucky-chinese-numbers).

I really wanted to go big and celebrate my birthday for once. But I hate planning and would rather do something low-key. We were supposed to hike today and got rained out so I decided to make a list of 28 ways to treat myself. Again, I hate planning so I just did a binch of stuff and am now creating the list after the fact. Enjoy!

1. Sleep in
2. Hang out with friends
3. Brunch
4. Walk the entire high line
5. Chai latte without nasty collagen supplements
6. Guilt-free purchase
7. Visit a museum
8. Help someone
9. Walk in the park
10. Flex on strangers with mad pull ups (aka 3)
11. Ice cream
12. Eat some place new
13. Eat red meat
14. Try new dessert
15. Have leftovers
16. Visit both of the sketchy 7-11s within in 2 block radius
17. Scratch off lotto tickets 
18. Take a bath
