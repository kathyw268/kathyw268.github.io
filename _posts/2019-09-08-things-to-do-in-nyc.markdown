### Thrifting
I think thrifting in Manhattan or NYC in general tends to have nicer clothes. There are multiple locations for each store so it depends what vibe you're going for.
- Buffalo Exchange
- Crossroads
- Housing Works

## Dining
The most important section. We can find food everywhere it just depends on what we want to do. I would say all the better food is in lower Manhattan.

* = places I've been to.
- Xi'an Famous Foods* (Hand Pulled Noodles)
- Cafe China* (Slighty fancy sichuan food)
- Tokyo Record Bar (You choose a song and they will play it as your food comes out)
- Niche*(Mazeman)
- Abiko Curry* (My friends are obsessed with this place. It's pretty good but it's just Japanese curry)


### Pizza
Since it's such a staple I figured it needed it's own section.

- Artichoke Pizza* (one of my favs but it's not NYC style pizza)
- Joe's Pizza* (classic slice)
- Prince Street Pizza (grandma style square pizza)
- Tappo's* (super super thin crust)
- Speedy Romeo*
