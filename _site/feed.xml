&lt;p&gt;This was my first and probably last camping trip of the year. All I wanted to do was see the stars. Above is my first real attempt at astrophotography. I was just excited that I was able to capture the stars that I didn’t stick around to shoot anything better.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, I turned 28 on the 28th). Growing up my mom constantly told me my birthdate is lucky. 8 is a lucky number in Chinese culture and I have 2 of them in my birthdate. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.tutorming.com/expats/lucky-and-unlucky-chinese-numbers&quot;&gt;Here’s a very credible source I found explaining why&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to go big and celebrate my birthday for once. But I hate planning and would rather do something low-key. We were supposed to hike today and got rained out so I decided to make a list of 28 ways to treat myself. Again, I hate planning so I just did a bunch of stuff and am now creating the list after the fact. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sleep in&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hang out with friends&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brunch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk the entire high line&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Chai latte without nasty collagen supplements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Guilt-free purchase&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visit a museum&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help someone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk in the park&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flex on strangers with mad pull ups (aka 3)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ice cream&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eat some place new&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Eat red meat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try new dessert&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have leftovers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visit both of the sketchy 7-11s within in 2 block radius&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scratch off lotto tickets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take a bath&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skip flossing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make list&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Belt out a song that is completely out of my range&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Listen to happy tunes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take the day off work&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wear my favorite outfit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mindless internet browsing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stay up late&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think about how great your friends are&lt;/li&gt;

I’m putting too many expectations on a single book but there are books that have affected my perspective and helped me grow as a person. I’m not necessarily recommending these books but they’ll give you a lot of insight on my personality and how I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;enders-game&quot;&gt;Ender’s Game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/book-covers/enders-game.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ender's Game Book Cover&quot; width=&quot;200px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read a lot as kid but I was mainly motivated by stickers and free pizza. Ender’s Game was the first book that I was forced to read that I really enjoyed. At the time, I just felt lucky that I was able to read a fun book for school. I later realized that it introduced me to a lot of philosophical concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It follows a boy named Ender as he trains in Battle School to become a soldier in humanity’s war against Buggers, an alien species. Ender is known for having the right balance of empathy and ruthlessness needed for war. He displays these traits throughout the book causing me to question my moral beliefs. Not saying I was a heartless child, but I never really considered the concept of compassion especially for characters that didn’t directly relate to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ender’s Game taught me how to care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it’s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. And then, in that very moment when I love them…. I destroy them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;into-the-wild&quot;&gt;Into the Wild&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/book-covers/into-the-wild.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Into the Wild Book Cover&quot; width=&quot;200px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book gets a lot of criticism for glamourizing “suicidal tendencies” but as someone who lives her life with reckless abandon, it resonated with me in a way I didn’t expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jon Krakauer details the true story of Chris McCandless, a young man who gives up all of his material possesions to embark on a journey of self-reliance. His lust for adventure leads him to the Alaskan wilderness where he meets his demise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was easy for me to relate to McCandless’ angsty demeanor and admire his passion for life but if you don’t have an affinity for the wilderness, his actions just seem impulsive and selfish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Into the Wild put my spirit into words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We like companionship, see, but we can’t stand to be around people for very long. So we go get ourselves lost, come back for a while, then get the hell out again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
